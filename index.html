            My hobby is coding in which I make Websites and Apps in my free time. Whenever I reach home after school I take a break of 2 hours and play outdoor game with my friends during this lockdown we play online games multiplayer. I am 12 years old and I am in 8th std. Now I know that I love making websites and apps in my free time.

Whenever I reach home after my school I spend my 2 hours in cylcling and roaming outside and enjoying after that I come to home and complete my home work after that I start continuing my website or app. Now I know that learning new things in our life is as important as your food. It can be good source of enjoyment, knowledge, inspirition and instruction. it helps you to find out your talent and most importantly a successful person in life.
